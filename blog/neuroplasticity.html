        <h1>1. Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
        <p><strong> - Connection between physical movement and mental state: </strong> One of the biggest strengths is understanding what movement does for the brain, and how close they are connected<em>“move your body, it will move your mind”. </em>Engaging in movement stimulates the brain, enhancing focus, creativity and emotional wellbeing.</p>
        <p><strong> - Neuroplasticty and growth: </strong>As well as understanding that nothing is fixed, you will improve, you just haven't yet. The more you practise a skill, the more your brain rewires itself, sending more neurons to the specific area involved in that task. This leads to gradual improvement in performance and learning.</p>
        <p><em>For me, knowing about neuroplasticity is one of the most important concepts you can understand. Over time the more you improve in all aspects of your life, you are in a cycle of improvement. </p></em>
        <h1>2. Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>- By becoming nearly obsessed with it,<em> practice, practice, practice. </em> Review what you have learnt because you can always learn more. </p>
        <p>- Moving your body, taking time for a little walk can wildly enhance your creativity and allow for clarity and further understanding. </p>
        <p>- I do repetitive activities or play games such as set, chess or sudoku, which can help sharpen my focus and improve problem solving. </p>
        <h2>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h2>
        <p>- I recommend the games above and a ted talk I found on improving your neuroplasticity which sums up everything I’ve said above.</p>

        <h1>3. Research Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h1>
        <p>- Growth mindset Is the understanding that you will learn it, you just haven't learnt it <strong>yet.</strong> Think about when you first learned to drive...it was stressful and unfamiliar, pushing you into the unknown. But over time, as you practiced, you gained more confidence and continued to improve. This same proof applies to any situation. If you're struggling to understand something now, remember that learning is a process. Just like driving, with time and persistence, progress is inevitable. </p>
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
        <p>- It further cemented my ideas that hard work does pay off and it is possible to understand complex topics with enough patience. </p>
        <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
        <p>- By understanding that learning takes time, and understanding I can’t do it all at once. To be patient and respect the process of learning.</p>
        <h2>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h1>
        <p>- I’d watched <strong>Andew Hubermans</strong><em> - “applying growth mindset” </em> a while back, he shares incredible insight into enhancing learning and performance.</p>

        <h1>4. Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
        <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
        <p>- One of my biggest goals is to have the ability to think deeply for long periods of time, and to master my chosen field. I find researching growth mindset and neuroplasticity only backs up my beliefs that it is possible, with enough practice, focus and time.</p>
