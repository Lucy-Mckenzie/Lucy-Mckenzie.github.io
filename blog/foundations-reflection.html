    <h1>Foundations reflection</h1>
    <p>
        As the foundations has come to an end, we've been asked to share our reflections for the human skills. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Understanding my learning style: </strong>One of the biggest realisations I have learnt in human skills is, about the way I learn best. Through the human skills training, I discovered that focusing on <em>higher-order thinking</em> from Bloom's Taxonomy, such as evaluation and analysis, leads to deeper engagement and better retention of information. This approach to learning has helped me structure my thoughts more effectively and identify strategies that work best for my problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Improved focus and deep thinking: </strong>One of the skills I was lacking in specifically was deep thinking and focusing. Over the past few weeks I’ve put a lot of effort into, comparing, evaluating, and analysing different codes which has helped me immensely in focusing on how to solve the problem at hand. This has been a turning point in my cognitive development and has allowed me to approach challenges with more clarity and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Awareness of my egos impact on learning: </strong>I’ve also learned how my ego can sometimes get in the way of my learning process. By reflecting on my approach to learning and problem-solving, I realised that I often rushed to conclusions or felt frustrated when I didn’t immediately understand something. By letting go of the need for instant success and embracing a growth mindset, I’ve become more patient and open to making mistakes, which in turn has accelerated my learning process.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Having <em>good values</em> and being aware of them is crucial not only for productivity but also for maintaining ethical standards in your work. Values like integrity ensure that you adhere to ethical principles, while empathy and communication strengthen collaboration within teams. Being self-aware of these values helps foster a positive, productive environment and can lead to better teamwork and innovation.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What has surprised you the most about Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned about myself, particularly my learning weaknesses. Taking the time to explore concepts like neuroplasticity and emotional intelligence gave me a deeper understanding of how I can improve my approach to learning and adapt to challenges. This has been especially insightful as I consider how to develop my skills and mindset for a career in the tech industry.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
        It was a little uneasy admitting to weaknesses so public, and being vulnerable about the fact that it takes me longer than some to understand difficult concepts. However, embracing that vulnerability has also been a key step in my personal growth. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p> 
        From my understanding, a big part of developing is working collaboratively and being able to explain technical concepts in a way that non-technical co workers or clients can understand. The ability to work alongside others, communicate what is happening in the code, and put yourself in the client’s shoes is key to understanding and achieving the project’s goals. Strong communication skills also allow you to negotiate or find compromises when necessary. Furthermore, as you advance in the programming world, you may have opportunities to lead or mentor others, where clear and concise communication becomes crucial for guiding teams and teaching effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Not in the slightest, I’ve found human skills very helpful as well as making blogs with the information we have gathered and learnt. It was a nice surprise and has further solidified my values, goals and strengths in life and in programming.
