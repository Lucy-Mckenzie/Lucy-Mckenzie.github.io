     <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <h2>
        Describe a time you were blocked on a simple problem
      </h2>
     <p>
        <strong>
            The problem:
        </strong>
        One challenge I faced was writing a function to solve a problem called "Super-Flip Flop" during Sprint 4. The function needed to pull information from another part of my code (flipflop) and integrate it into function (super-flipflop). As I am still new to various methods for manipulating data, I wasn’t familiar with helpful methods like .push() and .map(), which would have made solving the problem easier.
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            The problem-solving techniques I used:
        </strong>
        I went over and over it while walking, figuring out if I’d missed anything (turns out I’d missed implementing the push method), I was a little to impatient to solve the problem to take time to reread the brief of what we were building. And after around 20 minutes of problem-solving (trying lots of different variations, almost trying to force my way through), I contacted the foundation's group, and another student replied with his pseudo-code, which had .push() in it. 
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            How did I felt throughout the process and what did I learnt:
        </strong>
        I felt frustrated and lost in the challenge and should have planned better. It was a good lesson on slowing down and taking time to understand the function. I learned the importance of outlining how the function works and visualizing its parts before coding, instead of blindly searching for the answer.
     </p>
     
     <h2>How do I elegantly solve problems</h2>
     <p>
        There were a few times, specifically during the JS Olympics and on FreeCodeCamp, where I understood the solution immediately. This happened with challenges like unscrambling the string, removing odd numbers, and later decoding the code in another part of the sprint. The satisfaction of getting the code right purely through intuition felt like a dream come true.
     </p>

     <h2>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help:
     </h2>
     <p>
        I first reached out for help because I deleted my .git repository from a blog file. I felt silly really because I should've known it was stored like that as we spent time learning all about git and repositories. 
        I was stressed and couldn’t push anything up to GitHub, and was lost as my terminal window was saying all sorts of things. 
        And then I thought, who cares, they’ve dealt with worse. It's probably easily fixable if I just reach out to someone who knows what they're doing. And it was. 
        After that, I decided if I am struggling it only benefits me to reach out, no one really cares.
