     <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <h2>
        Describe a time you were blocked on a simple problem
      </h2>
     <p>
        <strong>
            The problem:
        </strong>
        I struggled with writing was when writing a function to solve a problem. The function was called the super flip flop in sprint-4. I basically had to grab the information from another part of my code and put it into another function for it to work as I wanted. Being new to the different methods (which are for manipulating codes), I wasn’t aware of the .push() or .map() methods, which could work for solving my problem. 
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            The problem-solving techniques I used:
        </strong>
        I went over and over it while walking, figuring out if I’d missed anything (turns out I’d missed implementing the push method), I was a little to impatient to solve the problem to take time to reread the brief of what we were building. And after around 20 minutes of problem-solving (trying lots of different variations, almost trying to force my way through), I contacted the foundation's group, and another student replied with his pseudo-code, which had .push() in it. 
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            How did I felt throughout the process and what did I learnt:
        </strong>
        I felt frustrated and lost in the challenge and should have planned better. It was a good lesson on slowing down and taking time to understand the function. I learned the importance of outlining how the function works and visualizing its parts before coding, instead of blindly searching for the answer.
     </p>
     
     <h2>How do I elegantly solve problems</h2>
     <p>
        I don't know how elegant my problem solving skills are at the moment but, I like to rope all my family into what I’ve been working on for the day, my brother knows a bit about coding and understands some concepts, I can explain in more detail to him. While explaining over the table what I’ve been working on I find I can explain it fairly easily by making analogies, and quickly refactoring the parts they don't understand to keep them engaged. 
     </p>
     <p>
     
        I enjoy visualizing how each part of the code interacts, and once I can see it clearly, everything clicks into place for me.
     </p>
     <p>
        Also sleeping, running or walking on a part of code I’m trying to understand is very helpful. I’ve solved a few codes right before going to sleep, the trouble is remembering it in the morning.
     </p>

     <h2>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help:
     </h2>
     <p>
        I first reached out for help because I deleted my .git repository from a blog file. I felt silly really because I should've known it was stored like that as we spent time learning all about git and repositories. 
        I was stressed and couldn’t push anything up to GitHub, and was lost as my terminal window was saying all sorts of things. 
        And then I thought, who cares, they’ve dealt with worse. It's probably easily fixable if I just reach out to someone who knows what they're doing. And it was. 
        After that, I decided if I am struggling it only benefits me to reach out, no one really cares.
