     <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <h2>
        Describe a time you were blocked on a simple problem
      </h2>
     <p>
        <strong>
            What was the problem:
        </strong>
        I struggled with writing a function to solve a problem. The function was called the super flip flop. I basically had to grab the information from another part of my code and put it into another function for it to work as I wanted. Being new to the different methods (which are for manipulating codes), I wasn’t aware of the .push() or .map() methods, which could work for solving my problem. 
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            What problem-solving techniques did you use:
        </strong>
        I wrote pseudo-code: 
        - Start with creating an empty array.
        - Write a for loop that loops through the (arrayParameter) where the array is stored.
        - Push the original flip-flop parameter into the new array.
        - Return the new array. 
     </p>
     <p>
        I also went over and over it while walking, figuring out if I’d missed anything (turns out I’d missed implementing the push method. After around 30 minutes of problem-solving, I contacted the foundation's group, and another student replied with his pseudo-code, which had .push() in it. 
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            How did you feel throughout the process?
        </strong>
        It was a good challenge. It felt good to take some time away and process all parts of the function to see what I was missing (I even dreamt about writing a similar code). 
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>
            What did you learn?
        </strong>
        I learnt that you should take the time to read and process exactly what the function will be doing, outline how your function will work and imagine the different parts before writing it so you aren't just feeling around blindly for the answer.
     </p>
     <h2>How do you elegently solve a problem</h2>
     <p>
        I like to rope all my family into what I’ve been working on for the day, my brother knows a bit about coding so he understands most concepts and I can explain in more detail to him. While explaining over the table what I’ve been working on I find I can explain it fairly easily by making analogies, and quickly refactoring the parts they don't understand to keep them engaged. 
     </p>
     <p>
        I also like to sit there and picture all parts of the code and how they work with one another, I find the moment I can imagine what a method is doing to the code it clicks for me.
     </p>
     <p>
        Also sleeping, running or walking on a part of code I’m trying to understand is very helpful. I’ve solved a few codes right before going to sleep, the trouble is remembering it in the morning.
     </p>
     <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pseudocode:  I like pseudo code but find it a lot more engaging to imagine the code layout in my mind. Writing down little hints or keywords can sometimes help though.</li>
        <li>Trying something: Love this technique, I think the more you try and fail the more the correct code becomes intuitive. </li>
        <li>Rubber ducky method: Also good, speaking the problem out loud can be very helpful. I will use this more in the future.</li>
        <li>Reading error messages: Very helpful, I’ve always liked to try and if it fails see why it's failing and go from there. (I like to start from the end and work back if that makes sense).</li>
        <li>Console.logging: Just like reading error messages, console.log is like a little window into the code, I find it helpful to have a response to what I’m doing. </li>
        <li>Googling: I mean, where would we be without it? I like to see other codes and figure out how I can implement that code into mine. </li>
        <li>Asking your peers for help: I feel very comfortable doing this, as we are all here to learn, and generally, people love to help.</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help:  It's something I'm working on, and making an effort to do, as It can be embarrassing admitting you don't know something.</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection: I think the key to learning successfully is reflecting on the day and highlighting parts you are struggling with. Otherwise, you can be learning blindly without solidifying the fundamentals. </li>
      </ol>
     <h2>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help:
     </h2>
     <p>
        I first reached out for help because I deleted my .git repository from a blog file. I felt silly really because I should've known it was stored like that as we spent time learning all about git and repositories. 
        I was stressed and couldn’t push anything up to GitHub, and was lost as my terminal window was saying all sorts of things. 
        And then I thought, who cares, they’ve dealt with worse. It's probably easily fixable if I just reach out to someone who knows what they're doing. And it was. 
        After that, I decided if I am struggling it only benefits me to reach out, no one really cares.
