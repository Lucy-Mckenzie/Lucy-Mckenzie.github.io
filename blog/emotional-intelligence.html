      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h2> 1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>  
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand and control one's feelings (self-awareness and self-regulation). It’s also the ability to read a social situation and understand others feelings and intentions. </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different from IQ </h2>
        <p>EQ differs from IQ in that it allows you to understand the world in an emotional sense, why things are the way they are, how fluid and flexible humans can be, and the ability to see things as they are. Whereas IQ focuses more on logical reasoning, problem solving, abstract thinking and knowledge retention. </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>I look at EQ as a lens to the world. Once you can differentiate what is important and what is not, life becomes a lot easier with intention. Understanding that emotions are temporary allows you to step back from immediate reactions and view them with a non-biased perspective. This self-awareness can lead to transformative changes, as the saying goes, 'You don’t know what you don’t know.' Developing EQ opens new dimensions of understanding, both about yourself and the world around you.</p>
