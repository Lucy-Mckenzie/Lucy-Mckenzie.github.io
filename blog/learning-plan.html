        <h2>
             1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p>
            My long-term goal is to find work that I am passionate about, where I can thrive and master my field, whether in cyber security, IT support, or software development. I enjoy guiding others and explaining complex topics, ensuring I not only understand what I’m doing but can also help others succeed.
        </p>
        <h2> 
            2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </h2>
        <p>
            My strengths and weaknesses are closely intertwined. For instance, once I grasp a concept, I can connect it to other details and navigate confidently. However, before I fully understand something, I often spend a lot of time struggling, as I’m missing the deep reflection needed for effective learning. I’ve learned the importance of stepping back, reflecting, or delving deeper into the issue. For example, I once spent weeks on a maths problem, repeatedly making the same mistakes, until I paused and questioned every part of the question until I fully understood it. One of my favourite quotes from my boss in France is, “If you keep making the same mistakes, you’re going to get the same results.” Though the context was in paragliding, this quote resonates with me every day.
        </p>
        <h2>
             3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I would like to focus on active recall and deep thinking, and am also open to other ideas that could strengthen my understanding of some of the more complex concepts. 
        </p>
        <h2> 
            4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h2>
        <p>
            By being friendly and open to other suggestions, listening and working with all other learners and facilitators. And if any problems arise where I don’t feel comfortable to deal with it myself to contact my facilitator and ask for suggestions.  When things are building up and I'm feeling out of my depth, I have great family support and feel very confident in reaching out and letting someone else know (whether it be a facilitator or a student). 
        </p>
        <h2>
             5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
            From what I’ve learnt so far a good approach is to work on the problem for 20 minutes or so. Take some time away and try again for another 20 minutes, unless really lost then to reach out to a facilitator or student group to get some advice.
        </p>
        <h2>
             6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.
        </h2>
        <p>
            I expect advice and support throughout my learning journey, to lead me in the right direction through trips and tricks.
        </p>
        <h2>
             7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
        </h2>
        <p>
            I’m lucky enough to have no other commitments, just coding and learning!!

        <h2>
            1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p>
            - Throughout foundations, I was often asked many questions I hadn't really thought of before.  One being what actually is my goal? I like interacting with people, negotiating and working to improve something and reach a goal. I also really enjoy working on my own and developing independent work I am proud of. I see myself in a lead position of some sort, as I learn more and more about the different outlets in technology, I still feel a pull towards cyber security, spatial data analysis, overall I am interested in a space people come to for help. 
        </p>
        <p>
            -  I am also aware that career choices are a dynamic process, and that as I gain more experience and self awareness, my goals will also evolve.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
            - I’ve become more aware that complex concepts just take practice and time to understand, a good example of this was when I was practising on freeCodeCamp before the foundations, I came to the javascript side and really struggled through parts. That really lowered my confidence in the analytical thinking side of programming. But I kept practising. A few days ago I revisited the same challenge and flew through it! It really shows perseverance wins in the face of complex challenges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - My ability to work hard and keep trying in the face of uncertainty will no doubt help me develop my skills through bootcamp. On the same note, I still have to work on taking time away and realising I don’t have to solve the problem right now. And that bowling my way through the problem without moving past it can be a big setback in understanding the problem. (It’s not about solving the problem and moving on, it's about understanding the problem.)
        </p>
        <p> 
            - The way I plan to balance this trait of mine is to work in the time frame and look to my cohort and other students to help me understand. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h2>
        <p> 
            - I can be a little shy in big groups explaining what I am doing, as it feels like there's no room for error. This is something I continually work on to improve and find once I get to know the group I can really relax. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            - Also I tend to throw myself Into work and push my way through even when I dont have the mental clarity for it, although I’ve been a little better lately at pulling myself away and going for a run or walk. 
        </p>
        <h2> 
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p> 
            - I would really like to develop skills in speaking to a broad audience comfortably, as well as finding good ways to explain the technical concepts we use. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </h2>
        <p>
            - I expect general guidance and feedback whether it be negative or positive, I believe the facilitators are going to have a big influence on ways I develop my problem solving skills for my future career in programming. And I look forward to taking on board all of the lessons I can possibly gather from the team!
        </p>
        <h2>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp.
        </h2>
        <p>
            - As I was saying above, I do not want to push through challenges without understanding the problem at hand. This is something I will continuously work on to improve my good habits in learning. If I am struggling to understand a problem after putting in a good effort I will reach out for further guidance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            - My goal is to be open and honest with myself and others at the boot camp as we are all here to learn. I’m excited to see other perspectives, and to talk through different ways of doing things.
        </p>
        <p>
            - I am excited for the challenge ahead!!
