        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My long-term goal is to find work that I am passionate about, where I can thrive and master my field, whether in cyber security, IT support, or software development. I enjoy guiding others and explaining complex topics, ensuring I not only understand what I’m doing but can also help others succeed.
        </p>
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>My strengths and weaknesses are closely intertwined. For instance, once I grasp a concept, I can connect it to other details and navigate confidently. However, before I fully understand something, I often spend a lot of time struggling, as I’m missing the deep reflection needed for effective learning. I’ve learned the importance of stepping back, reflecting, or delving deeper into the issue. For example, I once spent weeks on a maths problem, repeatedly making the same mistakes, until I paused and questioned every part of the question until I fully understood it. One of my favourite quotes from my boss in France is, “If you keep making the same mistakes, you’re going to get the same results.” Though the context was in paragliding, this quote resonates with me every day.</p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I would like to focus on active recall and deep thinking, and am also open to other ideas that could strengthen my understanding of some of the more complex concepts. </p>
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
        <p>By being friendly and open to other suggestions, listening and working with all other learners and facilitators. And if any problems arise where I don’t feel comfortable to deal with it myself to contact my facilitator and ask for suggestions.  When things are building up and I'm feeling out of my depth, I have great family support and feel very confident in reaching out and letting someone else know (whether it be a facilitator or a student). 
        </p>
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>From what I’ve learnt so far a good approach is to work on the problem for 20 minutes or so. Take some time away and try again for another 20 minutes, unless really lost then to reach out to a facilitator or student group to get some advice.</p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>I expect advice and support throughout my learning journey, to lead me in the right direction through trips and tricks. </p>
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>I’m lucky enough to have no other commitments, just coding and learning!!</p>
