          1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

          During my time travelling through the Balkans in Europe I spent a month in Turkey. I was very interested in experiencing the local culture as I’d just spent a few weeks in a very touristy area. I chose to do some volunteering in a place called Akaya, where I camped with a small team of people building eco earth homes with natural materials (hay, earth, wood, stone ect..). I chose this project as their ethical building approaches aligned with my values. I stayed for around two weeks, In less than ideal conditions for example: there were no toilets or showers, meaning you had to use the bush and shower yourself with a bucket of water. It was also rich in red earth (meaning you walked around with the earth on everything, all clothes were red afterwards). One night it rained for hours, which is when I found out my tent was in a river bed. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to stay and help for the period I intended as I was important for me to help on this project and support the locals with a suitable house to live in so they didn't have to live in the conditions I described.

            I am part of a tight knit family of six, growing up we spent three years travelling around Australia in a caravan, exploring the coast and bush. This has shaped me and my family to be free and independent thinkers. Where growth and learning are continuous elements of life. My parents are both business owners which only powers my belief that with enough hard work and determination anything really is possible.

            As an avid games player, I find one of the best ways for me to learn is through patterns and structures over memorisation. One of the reasons I am studying coding in the first place is that it directly aligns with my strengths of solving problems. I’ve also been told throughout my life that my determination, drive and passion are some of my key assets.

            4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

          <p>
            Some complex concepts can take me longer than usual to understand, I struggle with this as I like to understand everything straight away. I can get frustrated and feel lost. However I’m aware of this weakness and have ways to avoid getting frustrated like,  taking time away and coming back, understanding that I don’t have to understand the complete concept I will understand it later on eventually, I also find looking up lots of different resources to be helpful and using chatGPT to explain it simply.

             5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
           </h2>
          <p>
            Coming from a family with two older brothers, I loved to boss them around and have everything my way. After working collaboratively with others (eg. managing a restaurant with a team of people) I soon realised that you have to take other people's opinions into consideration, even when you think you are right and they're wrong. During meetings I would have conflict with other managers sometimes over small issues. But after talking it out I learnt it makes me feel much better to listen and try other people's suggestions because lots of the time they were right! This was a huge learning curve for me.
